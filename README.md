# sorting-package

This repository contains my solutions to Python homework 8.

## Structure

The code is organized into directories:

*   `src/`: Contains all source code.
*   `src/sorting/`: Аll the sorting is in this package.
*   Each sorting implementation is in a separate module (e.g., `src/sorting/quicksort/`, `src/sorting/heapsort/`).
*   `tests/`: Contains tests to verify the correct operation of sorting.
